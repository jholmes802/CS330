1. How do I approach designing software?
 - This project has helped me develop my familiarity with compiled languages and the rendering workflow for 3D spaces. I tried to focus on testing early and often by checking that each change worked and it helped identify each section and what needed work as I developed. This will help me tackle larger projects and understanding the workflow for compiled software. I also look forward to working with 3D rendering more as I tweak parts.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
 -While developing my 3D scene I tried to have a scene in mind, something so that I could plan out what it should look like and how I would want it to work. Understanding each piece and how things were supposed to work, like rendering the object then applying layers over it are helpful to me. As I developed I tried to keep track of my changes and when I realized there was a better way to do something I would try to take the time to rebuild my code to optimize. 

4. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 - These new skills will help me understand workflow and strategies to manageing time, expections and resources. So I will need to focus on ensuring that I spend the right amount of effort on planning and understnading how the software is going to flow and work together. These things are important not just in my professional but educational career as well. These skills are transferable to many things so its useful to know how to make them apply to other things.
